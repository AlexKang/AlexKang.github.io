		<h1>Overview</h1>
		IoT Hacks is all about the interaction between electrical engineering and computer science.
		We want to get beginners and experts alike more interested in building awesome stuff using
		hardware. 
		<p>
		Our goal with this hackathon is to create a small, nurturing environment with a heavy
		emphasis on mentorship. By the end, we hope everyone is able to create a cool project that
		combines microcontrollers, the Internet, and a real world appliance.
		<p>
		Think of ideas like fitness projects, room enhancement projects, kitchen appliance projects,
		and more! At the end, everyone will present their projects to judges. It’s going to be an
		awesome time, and we’re all really excited for all of you to take part in it!

		<h1>Prizes</h1>
		As with any hackathon, IoT Hacks is going to feature prizes! Winners will be selected based
		on a number of factors, including the utility of their idea, the technical sophistication
		of their project, and the learning process that the team went through to get to a final
		product. Our prize pool is diverse, and includes cool items like:
		<ul>
			<li>Arduinos</li>
			<li>Amazon Gift Cards</li>
			<li>Jawbone Ups</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Apply</h1>
		Anyone is welcome to walk in and participate, but we will only provide hardware and food for
		people who apply ahead of time.
		<p>
		20 teams of two or more will be randomly selected to receive a free <a target="_blank"
		href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-huzzah-esp8266/overview">IoT Dev Board</a>
		, complete with a USB cable and a breadboard. We will notify the chosen teams one week
		before the hackathon, at the latest.
		<p>
		We can also fufill minor hardware requests if you let us know on the application!

		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<h3>Are non-Berkeley students allowed to apply?</h3>
		Unfortunately, due of the size and scope of this hackathon we are only allowing Berkeley
		students to participate.
		<h3>What experience do I need to participate?</h3>
		Our mentors are willing to help you get started, but having previous knowledge of Python or
		C is highly recommended. The provided development board comes pre-programmed with <a
		target="_blank" href="https://www.lua.org/start.html">Lua</a>, which is very similar to
		Python semantically. We will also send out an email with useful links to get started with
		the provided hardware before the hackathon.
